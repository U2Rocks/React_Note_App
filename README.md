# React Notepad App

## Summary

This project was a small prototype of a react app that allowed users to save and mark small sticky notes onto a web page. The project uses tailwindcss for styling.

## Bugs and Other Issues

The main bug with the project is that deleting the notes in the wrong order will break the "X" Button until the page is reset.
Another bug is that creating notes saves the contents of the previous note in memory and can cause weird behaviors.

### Other Details

This project used yarn for its creation.
